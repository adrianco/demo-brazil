## Test Configuration

```json
{
    "mcp_server": "http://localhost:3000",
    "neo4j": {
        "uri": "bolt://localhost:7687",
        "auth": ["neo4j", "neo4j123"]
    },
    "protocol": "JSON-RPC 2.0",
    "test_type": "End-to-End",
    "data_source": "Kaggle Brazilian Football Dataset"
}
```

## Notes and Observations

1. **Data Quality**: The Kaggle dataset provides rich information about Brazilian football
2. **Performance**: All queries execute within acceptable time limits (<1s)
3. **Async Issues**: Some player search operations show async loop warnings but still return data
4. **Data Coverage**: Not all entities have complete relationships (e.g., some teams lack stadium info)
5. **Tool Functionality**: All 13 MCP tools are operational and returning appropriate responses

## Recommendations

1. ✅ Core functionality is working correctly
2. ✅ MCP server properly handles JSON-RPC requests
3. ✅ Neo4j queries execute efficiently
4. ⚠️ Consider fixing async loop issues in player tools
5. ✅ Data model supports all required queries
