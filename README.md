# Brazilian Soccer MCP Knowledge Graph 🇧🇷 ⚽

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation providing intelligent access to Brazilian soccer data through a Neo4j graph database. This project enables Claude AI to answer complex questions about Brazilian soccer players, teams, matches, and competitions.

## NOTE: This repo was used as part of an AI demo
The initial setup and installation of Claude and Claude-Flow was done in Codespaces. The idea for the demo was a brief chat with the Claude mobile app, saved as a file in the repo. Claude was used to install and document Neo4j. Then on the day of the demo, claude-flow was run. Most of the prompts and some of the results are recorded in prompts.txt. Claude-flow ran for about 1hr before completing the task. On trying to run the BDD tests, more problems were found and fixed. Claude had to be told to download the full dataset, and to fix all the problems so that 100% had no errors, and to run end to end BDD tests against the live database. The testing process resulting in a functonal demo took around another hour, with occasional guidance. Datasets used from Kaggle are public data, not up to date and the player dataset was based on the FIFA game data, but commercial data sources are available as described in the doc and could be integrated for more realistic results at higher cost and download time.

## 📋 Project Overview

This implementation follows the three-phase approach outlined in `brazilian-soccer-mcp-guide.md`:

- **Phase 1 (Core Data)**: Neo4j graph database with Brazilian soccer entities
- **Phase 2 (Enhancement)**: MCP server with 13 specialized query tools
- **Phase 3 (Integration)**: BDD testing with pytest-bdd

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Neo4j Database** (Community Edition)
   - Already configured at `bolt://localhost:7687`
   - Credentials: `neo4j` / `neo4j123`
   - See `docs/neo4j-setup.md` for details

2. **Python 3.8+**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/demo-brazil.git
cd demo-brazil

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install neo4j pytest pytest-bdd pandas click

# 3. Start Neo4j (if not running)

## 🔧 MCP Server Tools

The server implements 13 specialized tools for querying Brazilian soccer data:

### Player Tools
- `search_player` - Search players by name, team, or position
- `get_player_stats` - Get detailed player statistics
- `get_player_career` - Get complete career history

### Team Tools
- `search_team` - Search teams by name
- `get_team_roster` - Get current team roster
- `get_team_stats` - Get team statistics

### Match Tools
- `get_match_details` - Get specific match information
- `search_matches` - Search matches by criteria
- `get_head_to_head` - Get team rivalry statistics

### Competition Tools
- `get_competition_standings` - Get league standings
- `get_competition_top_scorers` - Get top scorers

### Analysis Tools
- `find_common_teammates` - Find shared teammates
- `get_rivalry_stats` - Analyze team rivalries

## 📊 Graph Schema

### Entities (Nodes)
- **Player**: Brazilian soccer players
- **Team**: Soccer clubs and teams
- **Match**: Individual matches
- **Competition**: Tournaments and leagues
- **Stadium**: Soccer venues
- **Coach**: Team coaches

### Relationships
- `PLAYS_FOR` - Player → Team
- `SCORED_IN` - Player → Match
- `COMPETED_IN` - Team → Match
- `HOSTED_AT` - Match → Stadium
- `PART_OF` - Match → Competition
- `COACHED_BY` - Team → Coach

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) with pytest-bdd:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific feature
pytest tests/features/player_management.feature -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Test Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: Player Search
  Scenario: Search for famous Brazilian player
    Given the knowledge graph contains player data
    When I search for "Neymar"
    Then I should get player details with career information
```
