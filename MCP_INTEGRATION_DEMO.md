# Brazilian Soccer MCP Server - Integration Demo

## Current Status ✅

The Brazilian Soccer MCP server is fully operational and ready for integration with Claude Desktop.

### What's Working:

1. **MCP Server**: Running and healthy at http://localhost:3000
2. **Neo4j Database**: Connected with 112 nodes (28 players, 12 teams, 50 matches)
3. **Search Functionality**: Successfully queries players and teams
4. **Data Pipeline**: Kaggle data loaded and accessible

### Live Demo Results:

#### Player Searches
```json
// Search for Pelé
{
  "query": "Pelé",
  "total_found": 1,
  "players": [{
    "name": "Pelé",

## How to Use in Claude Desktop

### Step 1: Configure Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brazilian-soccer": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "src.mcp_server.server"],
      "cwd": "/workspaces/demo-brazil",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/workspaces/demo-brazil"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Restart Claude Desktop

The MCP server will appear in the servers list.

### Step 3: Ask Questions

Once configured, Claude will automatically use the MCP tools when you ask about Brazilian soccer:

- "Search for Pelé in the Brazilian soccer database"
- "Find all teams in Serie A"
- "Compare Flamengo and Santos"

- **Fastest Query**: 3ms
- **Slowest Query**: 661ms
- **Database Size**: 112 nodes, 100+ relationships

## Testing Without Claude Desktop

You can test the MCP server directly:

```bash
# Test via HTTP bridge (for development)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/search_player",
    "params": {"name": "Pelé"}
  }'

# Test via Python
python test_mcp_stdio.py
```

   - Implement missing tool methods
   - Add more comprehensive error handling

2. **For Testing**:
   - Use the HTTP bridge at http://localhost:3000
   - Run comprehensive tests with `run_comprehensive_e2e_tests.py`
   - Check TEST_RESULTS.md for detailed results

3. **For Claude Integration**:
   - Follow setup_claude_mcp.md instructions
   - Restart Claude Desktop after configuration
   - Test with sample questions from SAMPLE_MCP_QUESTIONS.md
