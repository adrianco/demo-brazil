"""
Brazilian Soccer MCP Knowledge Graph - Player BDD Step Definitions

This module implements step definitions for player-related BDD scenarios using pytest-bdd.

Context Block:
- Purpose: BDD step implementations for player management features
- Framework: pytest-bdd with Gherkin syntax
- Scope: Player creation, querying, updating, validation
- Integration: Tests MCP server, graph database, and data pipeline
