"""
Brazilian Soccer MCP Knowledge Graph - Team Queries BDD Tests (Complete)

CONTEXT:
This module implements BDD step definitions for team queries.
Tests validate team search, statistics, rivalries, and comparisons.

PHASE: 3 - Integration & Testing
PURPOSE: Complete BDD test implementation for team features
DATA SOURCES: Mock MCP client and Neo4j driver
DEPENDENCIES: pytest, pytest-bdd, unittest.mock

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Neo4j Connection: Mocked for testing
- Graph Schema: Team entity with relationships
- Performance: Fast mock responses
- Testing: Given-When-Then BDD scenarios
