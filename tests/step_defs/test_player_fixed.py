"""
Brazilian Soccer MCP Knowledge Graph - Player Management BDD Tests (Fixed)

CONTEXT:
This module implements BDD step definitions for player management scenarios.
Tests validate player search, statistics, career tracking, and analysis features.

PHASE: 3 - Integration & Testing
PURPOSE: Complete BDD test implementation for player features
DATA SOURCES: Mock MCP client and Neo4j driver
DEPENDENCIES: pytest, pytest-bdd, unittest.mock

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Neo4j Connection: Mocked for testing
- Graph Schema: Player entity with relationships
- Performance: Fast mock responses
- Testing: Given-When-Then BDD scenarios

INTEGRATION:
- MCP Tools: Tests player_tools functionality
- Error Handling: Validates error responses
- Rate Limiting: N/A for mocked tests
