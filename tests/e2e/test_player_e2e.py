Brazilian Soccer MCP Knowledge Graph - Player Management E2E Tests

CONTEXT:
This module implements end-to-end BDD tests for player management
against the real MCP server and Neo4j database.

PHASE: 3 - Integration & Testing
PURPOSE: End-to-end testing with real data
DATA SOURCES: Live Neo4j database with Brazilian soccer data
DEPENDENCIES: pytest, pytest-bdd, real MCP client

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Tests run against actual MCP server
- Queries real Neo4j database
- Uses actual Brazilian soccer data
- Full integration testing
