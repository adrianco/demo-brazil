Brazilian Soccer MCP Knowledge Graph - Graph Builder

CONTEXT:
This module implements Neo4j graph population for the Brazilian Soccer Knowledge Graph
MCP server. It provides tools for loading entities into Neo4j, creating relationships,
and managing batch operations for optimal performance with Brazilian football data.

PHASE: 1 - Core Data
PURPOSE: Load entities into Neo4j and create all relationships
DATA SOURCES: Processed data from kaggle_loader module
DEPENDENCIES: neo4j, logging, typing

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Neo4j Connection: bolt://localhost:7687 (neo4j/neo4j123)
- Graph Schema: Player, Team, Match, Competition, Venue nodes with relationships
- Performance: Batch operations for large datasets with progress tracking
- Testing: BDD scenarios with sample Brazilian teams and players

INTEGRATION:
- MCP Tools: Receives clean data from kaggle_loader module
- Error Handling: Validation, rollback operations, and recovery
- Rate Limiting: N/A for offline data processing

ARCHITECTURE:
The graph builder follows a systematic approach to populate the Neo4j database:

LOADING STRATEGY:
1. Create all entities (nodes) first
2. Establish relationships between entities
3. Add indexes and constraints for performance
4. Validate graph integrity

ENTITY LOADING ORDER:
1. Competitions (independent entities)
2. Stadiums (independent entities)
3. Teams (independent entities)
4. Coaches (independent entities)
5. Players (independent entities)
6. Seasons (independent entities)
7. Matches (depends on teams, competitions, stadiums)
8. Goals (depends on matches, players, teams)
9. Cards (depends on matches, players, teams)
10. Transfers (depends on players, teams)

RELATIONSHIP TYPES:
- PLAYS_FOR: Player -> Team (current team)
- COACHES: Coach -> Team (current coaching position)
- HOSTED_AT: Match -> Stadium
- PART_OF: Match -> Competition
- IN_SEASON: Match -> Season
- SCORED: Player -> Goal
- RECEIVED: Player -> Card
- TRANSFERRED: Player -> Transfer
- HOME_TEAM: Match -> Team
- AWAY_TEAM: Match -> Team

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Batch operations for large datasets
- Transaction management for data consistency
- Memory-efficient processing for large files
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

USAGE:
```python
from src.data_pipeline.graph_builder import GraphBuilder

builder = GraphBuilder(db_connection)
builder.build_complete_graph()
